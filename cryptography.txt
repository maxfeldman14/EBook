<Title> Cryptography </Title>

<Section> Background </Section>
Goal 1 = secure communication
SSL/TLS: 
1. handshake protocol: to establish shared key (using public key crypto)
2. record layer: transmit data using this key
Goal 2 = protected files
E, D: cipher
k: secret key
m, c: plaintext, ciphertext
n:  nonce   (aka IV)
Encryption algorithm is publicly known - never use a proprietary cipher
Use cases:
single use (one time) key:
only used once to encypt one message. no need for nonce.
eg. one time pad. c = E(k,m) = m XOR k
D(k,c) = c XOR k
multi use (many time) key:
used to encrypt multiple messages. need either unique or random nonce.
stream cipher:
c = E(k,m) = m XOR PRG(k)
if key is used more than once - insecure:
c1 XOR c2 = m1 XOR m2

<Section> Block Ciphers </Section>
block ciphers - built by iteration
R(k,m): round function
input: (m,k), repeat simple mixing operation several times
difficult to design: must resist differential, linear, brute-force attacks, many others

PRF:      F:  K x X  ->  Y    such that:    
exists “efficient” algorithm to eval. F(k,x)
PRP:     E:   K x X  ->  X     such that:
1. Exists “efficient” algorithm to eval. E(k,x)
2. The func   E( k, . )   is  one-to-one
3. Exists “efficient” algorithm for inverse  D(k,x)

A block cipher is a PRP

Secure PRFs, PRPs
A PRF   F: K ? X  ?  Y  is secure if 
       F(k, . )  is indistinguishable from a random func.  f: X -> Y 
A PRP   E: K ? X  ?  X  is secure if 
       E(k, . )  is indisting. from a random perm.  pi: X -> X
	   
<Section> Using block ciphers </Section>
ECB: if m1 = m2, then c1 = c2
CBC with IV: best to use a random IV for every message
CTR mode with random IV: parallelizable

<Section> Message Integrity </Section>
provide integrity, not confidentiality.
non-keyed checksum (CRC) is an insecure MAC
attacker can receive tag for any message they choose-
goal is to produce a new valid message/tag pair
A secure PRF gives a secure MAC:
– S(k,m) = F(k,m)
– V(k,m,t):   output `yes’ if  t = F(k,m) and `no’ otherwise
ECBC, HMAC (hash-MAC: most common for internet), PMAC (parallel MAC)

<Section> Authenticated Encryption </Section>
CCM: CBC-MAC then CTR mode encryption
GCM: CTR mode encryption then MAC
EAX: CTR mode encryption then OMAC
All support AEAD: (auth. enc. with associated data)
Power cryptanalysis- analyze power consumption-
~1000 ciphertexts to expose secret key
